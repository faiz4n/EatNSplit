## 🧩 Features

- Add new friends with custom names and avatars
- Select a friend to split a bill with
- Enter total bill, your share, and who paid
- Dynamically updates who owes what
- Toggle form visibility (Add Friend / Close)
- Clean logic-based UI, no alerts or modals

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **React.js** – UI components, props, state, JSX
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – logic, conditionals, input handling
- **Vite** – fast build tool and dev server
- **HTML + CSS** – basic styling and layout

## 📦 What I Learned (and Reinforced)

This project didn’t introduce new concepts, but helped me **solidify** core React skills:

- ✅ Managing multiple slices of state with `useState`
- ✅ Controlled inputs and form handling
- ✅ Conditional rendering based on real-time logic
- ✅ Lifting state up and passing props across components
- ✅ Structuring clean, reusable components (`Friend`, `FormAddFriend`, `FormSplitBill`, `Button`)
- ✅ Thinking in terms of user interaction → UI → logic → state
